# Editor w/ Javascript

I built this project to learn about editors. End goal is to build a PDF-editor.

#### My goal with this project.
  - Build an editor
  - Generate SVG from canvas
  - Create a editor menu


Built an editor with the library Konvajs. Purpose was to create a componentbuilder for the web. 
This creates an svg to your clipboard.
